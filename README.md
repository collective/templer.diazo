templer.diazo
=============

Skeleton for a Diazo package for use with Plone

This repo is currently a placeholder for a Diazo templer skeleton

Please talk to Steve (stevem) or Cris (cewing) before developing here.

Goals:

* Support a pattern where a theme has been created TTW and the theme developer 
  needs to make it portable/versionable or to modify templates with jbot.

* Offer an option to either create a template ruleset or leave it empty to
  receive a plone.app.theming expot.

* If creating a sample ruleset, do we want to offer options for the handing of
  css/js resources: bare or using Plone's js/css?
